Details pertaining the final project of Jordan Kalms, Ignacio Caviedes, and Jim Yu for the Simplilearn Cybersecurity Course.

Greetings, this is an overview pertaining to the development and process behind our final project for the Simplilearn Cybersecurity Course. We will elaborate and expand on various elements that were not able to be included in our final video presentation.

To start with, here is our final presentation itself: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V-Jin5q2f9Ufg81z8xENxG5RY0C3sXRS/view

Our initial plan was to write a worm and explain how it functioned and affected the system, but that turned out to be beyond the scope of what was reasonable to complete in the given timeframe. We then turned to looking for viruses to download and demonstrate the effects of on a virtual machine, and settled on PyRAT. This allowed us to demonstrate the effects of a random access trojan while also delving into the mechanism on how it ends up on a computer and how to mitigate its effects.

Ultimately, we settled on using the Quasar RAT from the PyRAT repository as our virus of choice for demonstration purposes. For more details on its exact abiltiies and functions, please check this link: https://github.com/quasar/Quasar

Additionally, Jordan recorded a much more in-depth demonstration of the Quasar RAT that was ultimately cut down for the final presentation. You can view the original, longer version here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/k3hflfkchwlaaazwwpgcn/Rat-Demo.mov?rlkey=q9dh206fehinugqueu2sy47x5&dl=0

Ignacio also recorded an in-depth video expanding on multiple sections of the project, including the mechanics behind the phishing email. It is viewable here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xmqr2126v50bcwgm6mocn/indepth.mp4?rlkey=yr80maoood0f2p0qabms7v3zj&dl=0

In hindsight, it would have been possible to hide the virus better by packaging it alongside a much larger file that Google Drive was unable to scan, and create a more realistic scenario. Ultimately, getting the virus onto the system was the most important part of the presentation anyways.

Thank you for viewing our Capstone Career Simulation Project!
